          <p>
            Welcome to Calm Oasis Spa. We are committed to safeguarding the
            privacy of our website visitors and service users. This privacy
            policy explains how we handle your personal data.
          </p>

          <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
          <p>We may collect and process the following data about you:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Personal identification information (name, email address, phone
              number, etc.) that you provide by filling in forms on our website.
            </li>
            <li>
              Details of your visits to our website and the resources that you
              access, including, but not limited to, traffic data, location
              data, weblogs, and other communication data.
            </li>
            <li>
              Information provided to us when you communicate with us for any
              reason.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>How We Use Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We use the information that we collect from you to provide our
            services to you. In addition to this, we may use the information for
            one or more of the following purposes:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              To provide information to you that you request from us relating to
              our products or services.
            </li>
            <li>
              To provide information to you relating to other products that may
              be of interest to you. Such additional information will only be
              provided where you have consented to receive such information.
            </li>
            <li>
              To inform you of any changes to our website, services, or goods
              and products.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Storing Your Personal Data</h2>
          <p>
            We take all reasonable steps to ensure that your data is treated
            securely and in accordance with this privacy policy. Unfortunately,
            the transmission of information via the internet is not completely
            secure and therefore we cannot guarantee the security of data sent
            to us electronically and the transmission of such data is therefore
            entirely at your own risk. Where we have given you (or where you
            have chosen) a password so that you can access certain parts of our
            site, you are responsible for keeping this password confidential.
          </p>

          <h2>Disclosing Your Information</h2>
          <p>
            We will not disclose your personal information to any other party
            other than in accordance with this privacy policy and in the
            circumstances detailed below:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              In the event that we sell any or all of our business to the buyer.
            </li>
            <li>
              Where we are legally required by law to disclose your personal
              information.
            </li>
            <li>To further fraud protection and reduce the risk of fraud.</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Third Party Links</h2>
          <p>
            You may find links to third-party websites on our website. These
            websites should have their own privacy policies which you should
            check. We do not accept any responsibility or liability for their
            policies whatsoever as we have no control over them.
          </p>

          <h2>Access to Information</h2>
          <p>
            The Data Protection Act 1998 gives you the right to access the
            information that we hold about you. Please note that any demand for
            access may be subject to payment of a fee which covers our costs in
            providing you with the data requested. Should you wish to receive
            details that we hold about you please contact us using the contact
            details below.
